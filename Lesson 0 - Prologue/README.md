## Lesson 0 - Prologue

### So, what are we doing?

We are going to be working with graphics and shaders and learning how to harness the power of the graphics card. We will be creating a small graphics engine and building an interactive, technical shader demo, all the while learning how to use the _OpenGL_ API, its modern programmable pipeline and its shading language _GLSL_. At the end of the course, you will have a portfolio of work, showcasing your knowledge on different rendering effects, transformations, 2D and 3D projections, and camera systems, amongst other things.

But most of all, we are going to have fun!

### So, why graphics & shaders?

Shader programming is the modern way of rendering in game development and shader jobs are abundant. Games and applications are becoming more visually complex and graphics cards are improving all the time, so we need a way to use that power directly. Furthermore, shaders are everywhere and are featured in APIs such as _OpenGL_, _DirectX_, _Vulkan_ and _Metal_. Game engines such as _Unity_ and _Unreal_ also allow programmers to write shaders, using their _CG_ and _HLSL_ shader languages, respectively.
