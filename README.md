# Fifty shades of RGBA
This course covers the introductory topics of _OpenGL_ and _GLSL_ and will teach students how to create a 3D scene with a camera, 3D objects, lighting, texturing, and text rendering. Each lesson covers a different topic and is broken down into theory and code samples.

### Lesson 0 - Prologue
_A very brief introduction to the course, who the target audience is, and what makes this course so special_.

### Lesson 1 - Getting to know your environment
_You will be introduced to the OpenGL API, including where and why it is being used. You will also learn all about Visual Studio, where to download it and how to manage the IDE. Some tips and tricks will be covered to help you write code faster. Finally, knowing how and where all your folders and files are structured and stored is essential before we begin developing the project_.

### Lesson 2 - A comprehensive introduction to graphics

_This will be a solid introduction to graphics and shaders, where you will learn all about the evolution of graphics, especially in games, and how far we have come in terms of hardware and software. You will gain a deeper understanding of the graphics pipeline, graphics cards and their drivers, and graphics APIs, especially OpenGL_.

### Lesson 3 - Window to the 3D world

_In this lesson, students will learn how to download and link the SDL library, which will aid them in creating and managing their application window. Students will add specific SDL code to their projects to create the main window as well as create the OpenGL rendering context. Finally, a main application loop will be added, wherein students will add some primitive OpenGL functions just to get a basic quad to render on screen_.

### Lesson 4 - Gimme some input

_Here, students will learn how the input polling process works and how different input events are triggered and dealt with. They will gain insight into reading keyboard and mouse input_.

### Lesson 5 - Start your graphics engines!

_This is where you will learn all about game engines with the intention to create your own graphics engine from scratch. The Singleton Design Pattern will be taught and used from this point forth to create manager objects for your engine. We will begin creating managers to encapsulate all of our screen and input functionality_.

### Lesson 6 - _OpenGL_...opened up

_We continue building upon our small graphics engine and learn all about extension functionality in OpenGL. We will learn the difficult method of manually loading extension functions from the graphics driver, as well as the simpler method using the GLAD 2.0 library. Finally, we are going to learn about some debugging techniques that we can utilize in OpenGL_. 

### Lesson 7 - The graphics pipeline

_In this lesson, we are going to delve into the graphics pipeline and gain a deeper understanding of vertex and fragment shaders, ending off with a good knowledge of GLSL_.

### Lesson 8 - Sending data down the pipeline I

_Here, we will learn how to pass data to our shaders, in the form of uniforms, vertex attributes and Vertex Buffer Objects. We will start by creating a single VBO to store and pass to the shader all of our position and color data for a simple shape_. 

### Lesson 9 - Sending data down the pipeline II

_Now, we progress to creating multiple VBOs for our data, before learning all about Vertex Array Objects and Index Buffer Objects. Finally, we will add code to our newly created Shader class to further control data management between the OpenGL application and the shaders_.
