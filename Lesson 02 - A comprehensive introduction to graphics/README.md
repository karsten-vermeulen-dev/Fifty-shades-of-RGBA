## Lesson 2 - The evolution of graphics

### Overview 

Graphics in games have come a long way, from simple graphical overlays to the advanced shader techniques used today. Hardware in the desktop PC and the console has evolved over the last 40 years and even tablets and smartphones have improved dramatically over the last decade and now run some pretty advanced games. The graphics card industry has fought many wars over the years and today _Nvidia_ and _AMD_ (and maybe _Intel_?) battle it out head-to-head to be the best. With the  addition of VR and AR in games, the graphics industry is certainly spanning out in new directions.

Before we begin, let’s take a look at some early video display standards. 

### Video display standards

These entail _aspect ratio_, _resolution_, _color depth_, _color palette_ and _refresh rate_, amongst other things and used to be a closed standard set by _IBM_, who set the standards for all IBM PCs and PC clones. The company also defined the main graphics standards and released graphics cards to go with their computers. The _Video Electronics Standards Association_, or _VESA_ for short later formed an open standard. _VESA_ is a non-profit organization consisting of over 200 companies that help set the standards to this day. Modern display standards now also include _power management_ and _device identification_. In the past, there have been many different video display standards and the following material will only highlight a few of them.

### MDA (not the drug)

Stands for _Monochrome Display Adapter_ and was introduced by _IBM_ and released in 1981. It was capable of displaying only pure text and no graphics because individual pixels could not be addressed. It was able to render 80x25 characters on screen, with each character being 9x14 pixels in dimension, giving it a resolution of 720x350. 
This standard supported a whopping total of 4KB of memory and games were generally made using ASCII art.

### Hercules (not the Greek hero)

This standard was created by _Hercules Computer Technology_ and released in 1982. It improved upon the _MDA_ standard by displaying text and graphics, as individual pixels could now be addressed. Boasting a resolution of 720x348, just like MDA, it did not display any color.

### CGA (it gets better!)

Also introduced by _IBM_ and released in 1981, this _Color Graphics Adapter_ could represent 16 colors using 4-bit color depth, with RGB components taking up 1 bit each and the 4th bit was for the color intensity. CGA was able to render monochrome graphics in a 640x200 resolution, 4-color graphics in a 320x200 resolution and 16-color graphics in a 160x100 resolution. The 4-color mode versions had different palettes to choose from and the cards supported a total of 16KB of memory. For 1-color modes, any color from the 16-color palette could be used.

### EGA (not the Spanish river)

With _IBM_ on a roll, they realeased this _Enhanced Graphics Adapter_ in 1984. EGA cards could represent 64 colors using a 6-bit color depth, with RGB taking up 2 bits each. EGA was able to render 16-color graphics in a 640x350 resolution, each color being chosen from the 64-color palette, and it had a compatible _CGA_ mode, whereby it was also able to render all 16 colors within the 640x200 or 320x200 resolutions. The cards supported a total of 256KB of memory.

### VGA (not the cable)

In 1987, _IBM_ gave us the _Video Graphics Array_, which could represent 262,144 colors using a 18-bit color depth, with RGB taking up 6 bits each. Amongst other _VGA_ modes, the most common ones were 16-color graphics in a 640x480 resolution, and 256-color graphics in a 320x200 resolution. The _VGA_ standard brought about the iconic 15-pin blue cable adapter and the 640x480 resolution, and today, this resolution is still the lowest common denominator for some systems and games. _VGA_ also began the era of creating graphics chips to process graphics instead of having a dedicated graphics board. Marking the end of an era, this was one of the last graphics standards that _IBM_ introduced before _VESA_ began to set the standards.

### Hey look there, it's _Super VGA_!

The _Super Video Graphics Array_ standard was introduced by _VESA_ and released in 1989 as an extension to _IBM_'s _VGA_ display standard. Originally defined to render 16 colors in a 800x600 resolution, it soon evolved to start rendering 256 (and more) colors in much higher resolutions. This standard marked the start of modern-day graphics standards that we see today.
