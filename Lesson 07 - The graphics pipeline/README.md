## Lesson 7 - The graphics pipeline

## The magic of shaders

Rendering in _OpenGL_ has drastically transformed and evolved over the years! As new technology emerges, the API constantly needs to keep up with latest demands and work in a more efficient manner. The newer programmable pipeline introduced shaders, which allows programmers more control over the graphics pipeline.
This pipeline is essentially a sequence of steps executed to transform a 3D model in its raw form into a 2D object displayed on the player's game screen
Previously, during the fixed-function era, all a programmer had was a set of pre-defined routines that manipulated the graphics pipeline automatically. This was less than ideal, and things needed to change.
