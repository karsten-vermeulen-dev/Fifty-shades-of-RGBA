## Lesson 3 - Window to the 3D world

## The first little graphics app

### Downloading _SDL_

We are going to be needing the assistance of _SDL_ to set up our _OpenGL_ context and applpication window. Head over [HERE](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) to find the latest release of the API. Make sure you select the _SDL2-devel-...-VC.zip_ and download that. Unzip the development files and place them in a folder called _Libraries_, under a sub-folder called _SDL_. <br> 
Because sometimes the files seem to be all over the place, it's a good suggestion to organise them in a _bin_, _include_ and _lib_ folder. The _bin_ folder should contain all the _runtime files_ (**.dll**), the _include_ folder all the _header files_ (**.h**) and the _lib_ folder the _static library files_ (**.lib**).
